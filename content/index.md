# Welcome to Read365.

I believe reading is still the most cost-effective activity to invest in yourself in year 2024. That is why I've decided to read 365 books in 2024 in my spare time. 

Let's try to frame this little challenge.

> If I had one year to initiate a global change for the better, and were allowed to read books only, which books would I choose?

Okay, it sounded a little bit try-hard I must admit.

But I know there are countless people who are willing to read, yet for some reason cannot create the time to read. So I have decided to document my year-long reading journey online, to inspi I imagine Read365 to be *a harbor for reading together*, a calm place for anyone that aspires to read regularly and to consistently improve themselves throughout the year.

And finally, I will be donating all 365 books to a high school library at the end of the year, because you know what they say: *Sharing is caring*.

Whoever reading this, I wish you a winning year. 

Let's begin.
