# Welcome to Read365.

I believe reading is still the most cost-effective activity to invest in yourself in year 2024. That is why I've decided to read 365 books in 2024 in my spare time. 

I know there are countless people who are willing to read, yet for some reason cannot create the time to read on a daily basis. So I have decided to document my year-long reading journey online, also to inspire those who might sometimes need just a daily reminder or an invitation to read a few pages. 

I imagine Read365 to be *a harbor for reading together*, a calm place for anyone that aspires to read regularly and to consistently improve themselves throughout the year.

And at the end of the year, I am donating all 365 books to a high school library, because... Why not?

Whoever reading this, I wish you a *winning* year.

Let's begin.
