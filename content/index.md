# Welcome to Read365.

I believe reading is still the most cost-effective activity to invest in yourself in year 2024. That is why I've decided to visit 365 books in 2024, and apply the wisdom to my own life.

I know there are countless people who are willing to read, yet for some reason cannot create the time to feed their minds on a daily basis. If you are one of them, you're lucky because I've decided also to document my year-long reading journey online, also to inspire those who might sometimes need just a daily reminder or an invitation to read a few pages. 

You can imagine Read365 to be *a harbor for reading together*, a calm place for anyone that aspires to read regularly and to consistently improve themselves throughout the year.

And at the end of the year, I am donating all books I read to a high school library, because... Why not?

Whoever reading this, I wish you a *winning* year.

Let's begin.
