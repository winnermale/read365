title: To inspire you to read actual books.

To be more specific, it is *to inspire humanity to read one book per month per person*.

*One book...*
*Per month...*
*Per person...*

It sounds audacious to me. And that is all I need for now. Just an audacious-sounding goal.

To be honest, I didn't check the numbers. And I hope it has not been achieved yet. Otherwise that would mean my idea doesn't work, and my cool plan immediately becomes obsolete. Selfish. But hey, at least it's human. Difficult to find it these days.

## A Note

To increase time spent on reading is only half of the story. You also need to produce some kind of output, and establish some form of *[[Input-to-Output Loop]]*.
