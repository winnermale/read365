> [!faq]- What is Read365?
> 
> Read365 is an effort to read 365 books in 365 days. It is a side project, and a self-experimentation by me, Efe.
> 
> Oh, and it also serves as the spark for a collective reading experience, a warm invitation to you, should you choose to contribute anytime you want... Well, technically it has to be some time in year 2024. But anyway...

> [!faq]- What is wrong with you?
> See, that's the point. I really don't know, and I hope to find an answer in books...
> 
> It was a joke. The goal of Read365 is two-fold:
> 1. To build a foundation in skills I assume I need to help you more effectively.
> 2. *[[To inspire you to read actual books.]]*

> [!faq]- But why?
> 
> I have a shower thought-turned hypothesis: 
> 
> > *If each individual on Earth read one book per month, all our current regional and global issues would vanish.*
> 
> Think about it for a moment.
> 
> No more domestic violence. No more energy waste. No more terrorism. No more water & food waste. No more climate crisis. No more cold showers. No more Taylor Swift... (One of them is a joke.)
> 
> Well, I should warn you that my hypothesis doesn't promise to solve any future problem that we don't even have yet. So, don't expect a WD-40. But still, the problems we're facing right now as we enter 2024 have would definitely go away.
> 
> And the premise for that is simple: *You always need a new perspective in order to solve your existing problem.* Your existing perspective will only grow your existing problem further, because it is your existing perspective that has led to your existing problem in the first place. Forgive me for using the word "existing" excessively. But what can you do? They just keep existing... (Sorry.)
> 
> Anyway... You have to somehow earn that new perspective to solve the problem. And guess what's the cheapest medium to store perspectives and to effectively deliver them to people at scale, so that people could synthesize new perspectives to solve existing problems?

> [!faq]- What books do you plan to read?
> 
> I will be choosing seven books at the beginning of each week, to explore the questions arising from my previous reads. Let's say whilst I'm reading a book on how to establish a strong business culture, I notice that the author emphasizes adopting a particular attitude, behavior or strategy in a domain that I'm not even remotely familiar with. That means I will most probably be digging into their suggestion next week via the book that talks about it, even if the book talks about it in a different context.

> [!faq]- How can I personally benefit this experiment?
> Following the Read365 experiment throughout the year could benefit you in a number of ways:
> 1. You can get inspired about what to read in 2024, by checking my weekly picks. I see each book as a ground for us to synthesize together, whether you have an intent to serve humanity by growing the next Big Tech, or you're just curious about sharpening relatively softer skills such as communication, storytelling, gathering people together in meaningful ways, managing tech teams, or writing for self-expression.
> 2. You can read my weekly synthesis letters by subscribing to Write52, a newsletter with a little bit try-hard name I literally just made up so that the two sound like a cool duo.

> [!faq]- How can I become part of this experiment?
> 
> First off, let me clarify this: you don't have to read hundreds of books to be part of Read365. Even a single book in a year is a win... Except, it's not if you already read one book last year. You have to increase it a little bit. Remember, the goal is to read one book per month. 10 pages a day. 10 minutes a day. Come on, don't tell me you can read only one book in an entire year while some random guy on the internet is devouring a book a day on average.
> 
> That said, there are a number of ways to contribute to this experiment and to help grow it:
> 1. Grab your book and join us in our daily reads sessions, streaming every day on our [YouTube]() channel.
> 3. Support the experiment financially in one of three ways:
> 	1. Join us on private [Discord](https://discord.gg/Pq9AH2Ra) space where we learn and practice how to express ourselves together. This space has a nominal membership fee as a paywall to keep the not-so-relevant people outside, and to nurture a psychologically safe place for us.
> 	3. Join to our YouTube channel.
