> 
> Read365 is an effort to read 365 books in 365 days. It is a side project, and a self-experimentation by me, Efe.
> 
> Oh, and it also serves as the spark for a collective reading experience, a warm invitation to you, should you choose to contribute anytime you want... Well, technically it has to be some time in year 2024. But anyway...

> [!faq]- What is wrong with you?
> See, that's the point. I really don't know, and I hope to find an answer in books...
> 
> It was a joke. The goal of Read365 is two-fold:
> 1. To build a foundation in skills I assume I need to help you more effectively.
> 2. *[[To inspire you to read actual books.]]*

> No more domestic violence. No more energy waste. No more terrorism. No more water & food waste. No more climate crisis. No more cold showers. No more Taylor Swift... (One of them is a joke.)

> Well, I should warn you that my hypothesis doesn't promise to solve any future problem that we don't even have yet. So, don't expect a WD-40. But still, the problems we're facing right now as we enter 2024 have would definitely go away.

> And the premise for that is simple: *You always need a new perspective in order to solve your existing problem.* Your existing perspective will only grow your existing problem further, because it is your existing perspective that has led to your existing problem in the first place. Forgive me for using the word "existing" excessively. But what can you do? They just keep existing... (Sorry.)
> 
> Anyway... You have to somehow earn that new perspective to solve the problem. And guess what's the cheapest medium to store perspectives and to effectively deliver them to people at scale, so that people could synthesize new perspectives to solve existing problems?

> [!faq]- How can I personally benefit this experiment?
> Following the Read365 experiment throughout the year could benefit you in a number of ways:
> 1. You can get inspired about what to read in 2024. I see each book as a ground for us to synthesize together, especially if you also have an intent to serve humanity by growing the next Big Tech, or if you're just curious about sharpening relatively softer skills such as communication, storytelling, gathering people together in meaningful ways, managing tech teams, or writing for self-expression.
> 2. You can read the weekly letters I will be synthesizing as I read, by subscribing to Write52, a newsletter with a little bit try-hard name I literally just made up so that the two sound like a cool duo.

But to increase time spent on reading is only half of the story. You also need to produce some kind of output. This is why I have created a closed community where people exchange the perspectives

> [!faq]- How can I become part of this experiment?
> First off, you don't have to read hundreds of books to be part of Read365, I promise. Even a single book in a year is a win... Except, it's not. Come on, don't tell me you can read only a single book in an entire year while some guy over here is grinding a book a day on average, even if he has the crack advantage (pun intended). Ehm, anyway...
