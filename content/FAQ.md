> [!faq]- What is Read365?
> 
> Read365 is an effort to read 365 books in 365 days. It is an entirely personal experiment by me, Efe. And it starts on January 1st, 2024. 
> 
> Oh, and it also serves as the spark for a collective reading experience, a warm invitation to you, should you choose to contribute anytime you want. 
> 
> Well, technically it has to be some time in year 2024. But anyway...
> 

> [!faq]- What is wrong with you?
> See, that's the point. I really don't know either, and I hope to find the answer in books... (Joke)
> 
> The goal of Read365 is to inspire people to read books. To be more specific, it is to inspire humanity to read at a rate of one book per month per person on average.
> 
> *One book...*
> *Per month...*
> *Per person...*
> *On average...*

> It sounds audacious. And that is all I need for now. Just an audacious goal.
> 
> To be honest, I didn't check the numbers. And I hope it has not been achieved yet. Otherwise that would mean my idea doesn't work, and my cool plan immediately becomes obsolete. Selfish. But at least it's human. Difficult to find it these days.

> [!faq]- But why?
> 
> I have an idea that's somewhere in between a hypothesis, and a shower thought. I started to believe that if each individual on earth were reading one book per month, all our regional and global issues would have vanished. Think about it for a moment... 
> 
> Well, I should warn you that my hypothesis doesn't promise to solve any future problem that we don't have yet. So, don't expect a WD-40. But still, the problems we currently have would definitely go away.
> 
> And there is a simple reason for that. *You always need a new perspective in order to solve your existing problem.* Your existing perspective will only grow your existing problem further, because it is your existing perspective that has led to the problem in the first place. Forgive me for using the word "existing" excessively. But what can you do? They just keep existing... (Sorry.)
> 
> Anyway. You have to somehow earn that new perspective. And guess what is the cheapest medium to store perspectives and to effectively transfer them between people at scale, so that people could synthesize even more perspectives to solve problems?

> [!faq]- How can I personally benefit this experiment?
> Following the Read365 experiment throughout the year could benefit you in a number of ways:
> 1. You can get inspired about what to read in 2024. I see each book as a ground for us to synthesize together, especially if you also have an intent to serve humanity by growing the next Big Tech, or if you're just curious about sharpening relatively softer skills such as communication, storytelling, gathering people together in meaningful ways, managing tech teams, or writing for self-expression.
> 2. You can read the weekly letters I will be synthesizing as I read, by subscribing to Write52, a newsletter with a little bit try-hard name I literally just made up to make the two sound like a cool duo.


> [!faq]- How can I become part of this experiment?
> First off, you don't have to read hundreds of books to be part of Read365, I promise. Even a single book in a year is a win... Except, it's not. Come on, don't tell me you can read only a single book in an entire year while some guy over here is grinding a book a day on average, even if he has the crack advantage (pun intended). Ehm, anyway...
