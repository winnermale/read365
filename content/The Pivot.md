To be honest, I was not expecting to pivot so early, but there we go:

I am pivoting Read365.

I started this personal project with a two-fold goal in mind: to read 365 books in 2024, and to share the gains on a website as I keep reading.

A little background about me: I'm a guy who intends to shape the world... for the better obviously. And I have certain hypotheses on how I could do it, one of which being somehow find a way to make the entire humanity attain a reading rate of *one book per month per person* on average. But why books in an age where? Let's leave to another synthesis letter.
