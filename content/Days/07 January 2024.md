# The First Letter

I was planning today to be the day to write the first Write52 synthesis letter, but I couldn't manage to do it, partly because I still couldn't properly re-structure my daily schedule and routines, and partly because probably I couldn't feel quite ready to do that.

I am planning to send the synthesis letters every tuesday, so I still have one more day. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can find the subscription button pretty much anywhere on the website.

Tomorrow will be a 1% better day.

Oh, and the main subject of the letter will be, *Pivoting*. I'll talk a bit about why and how you should pivot fast, even when you had emotionally invested so much in your previous stance.

See you.
