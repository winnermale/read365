# Day 4 Already?

It feels weird I feel like I've accomplished a lot (even though I am one book behind the schedule), and at the same time I feel like time has just flied like crazy these first couple days. Did you feel it?

- To be honest I didn't choose today's book. I'd like to read something fun, maybe some [[Marcel Proust]]? Maybe it is too soon.
