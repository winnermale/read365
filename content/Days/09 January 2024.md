It is quite late over here, and I don't have much to say for today. But again, what matters is the stream of consciousness that pour outs of the intent to keep it going.

## Actually, I might have something to say.

I've been doing the daily [reading together streams on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@read365org) almost religiously. This is weird, but I even feel comfortable doing it. Maybe that is because there's still only, so there's no social pressure whatsoever on my shoulders yet.

There are certain problems with this *harbor for reading* thought:
1. I haven't yet promoted it to my social circle, maybe in the hope of being discovered organically over time. But I am slowly losing faith in this possibility, so I might start inviting bookworms to the harbor at any moment. 
2. The time is not fixed yet, and that's not a good thing. I know that human beings desperately need consistency for a series of events to naturally slip into their own daily routines, so I wouldn't blame anyone for not being able to join me even if they already know I'm doing them every day. Reading a couple pages on a daily basis is already ridiculously difficult for most people on earth, so trying to keep up with a series of events would only make things worse.

The new book I've started is named [[Product-Led Onboarding]], which talks about bettering the... that's right, the onboarding process of products and services, and mainly software solutions such as SaaS. 

And why do I even bother reading this book? Because my friend, soon I will be having some teams that I'll be building fantastic products with, and I'd like to navigate the development process with certainty.

## But, what about the newsletter?

This is becoming such a heavy task. I feel like I have to deliver the best synthesis letter ever, even though *the perfect newsletter is a myth.*

I am already behind the reading schedule, and I haven't reached the mometum I need yet.
