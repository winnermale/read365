Today, I'll be doing a 2-hour reading together session on our [YouTube harbor](https://www.youtube.com/@read365org). And I'm still planning to do a second pacific time-friendly session.

## About the Letter Issue (Pun Intended)

The second synthesis letter should have been written by now, but I still have nothing at hand.

I guess I just found out why I still haven't written the first synthesis letter. Because I'm a nasty perfectionist when it comes to delivering final outputs. A newsletter has always been the means of a value exchange where I'm on the receiving end. And I assume the ones that I had been exposed to are the better examples of such a craft. By the way, do you notice how I'm almost performing a mental surgery on myself and talking about it simultaneously in public? Well, technically four people are reading. And they're all friends. 

Anyway... A better framing to the process of starting a weekly newsletter would be to assume that each letter is not an output, but an iteration. The goal is to reach the perfect letter by the end of the year. 

Now I am relieved. Expect something random as the first letter. Nope, I won't go that far.

==PS== I am surprising myself that I am just writing these daily letters so irresponsibly. What an irony! This is just another proof that if you just ignore the grumpy old f\*ck in your mind that lives rent-free and seeks constant perfection, you might just magically do the thing.

I guess in [[Bhagavad Gita]], there's a saying:

> You have the right to the action, but not to the fruit of the action.
