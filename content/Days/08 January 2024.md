Hey friends. Today, I will be doing the [2-hour reading session](https://youtube.com/live/mPwVTE1l8wI?feature=share) at 22:00 GMT+3. Meanwhile, you can just grab a book and I will catch up with you.

## Redefining the Read365 Brand

As one of the main premises of the platform, I will be testing the books I read in my own life and document the results with you all, instead of jumping from one to the other. I assume we are all aware that it is not the number of pages you read, but the experiment-to-read ratio, that matters about books. 

As I went through the book *Building a StoryBrand*, I came to realize that even Read365.org needs a proper brand, albeit I am conducting it as an experiment at the personal level.
