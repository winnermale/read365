# January 5th.
## The Plan

- I will be reading the book [[Building a StoryBrand]]. Grab a book and join today's [live session](https://youtube.com/live/kRH6EU29w5k?feature=share) at our YouTube harbor for reading together, at 8pm GMT+3.
- I am working on a wishlist of books that I really wish to read throughout the year, in order to synthesize new perspectives for you. When it is ready, I'll put a link of it, so that you'll be able to donate a book for the cause. 
	- ==PS== At the end of the year, all 365 books will be donated to a high school library for them. So you'll be technically donating one of the best books in the list to our younger friends.

## Getting More and Less Difficult

The sudden and drastic shift in my daily reading routine is already pushing my limits. Change is a quite interesting phenomenon. Change in reality always has multiple layers to it, and one must be prepared not only for the immediate effects, but more so for the higher order consequences of the change they're pursuing.

I admit that I was not expecting it to be this difficult. But, here we are.

## Proust was a bad idea.

[[In Search of Lost Time]], the magnum opus by [[Marcel Proust]] is a book that was in my reading list, desperately waiting for its turn for many years. And the other day I thought, "Okay, why not now Proust? You could be one of the lucky 365." But oh boy, what a heavy duty it turned out to be!

The vast majority of the books I read in the past few years were non-fiction on the fields I was curious about, I was already feeling myself gradually drifting away from literature, and possibly forever. Partly terrified from the possibility that I could lose all my appreciation for fiction, I decided to mix a little bit of those to the hundreds of more "serious" expert books on specific domains of knowledge. I still think that's the right way to read 365 books, but probably not Proust, especially if you haven't worked your fiction muscles in a long time.
