# Let's begin.

## Humble Beginnings

I'm planning to do the first reading session at 20:30 Istanbul time (GMT+3). That is probably 09:30 pacific time. And 18:30 Milano time. It will probably be somewhere [here](https://www.youtube.com/@read365org). If you cannot find it, just send me a message.

I will be streaming with a 720p webcam, and I will probably be reading the book [[Atomic Habits]].

## Remarks

1. I forgive YouTube.
	1. YouTube does not allow for live streaming during the first 24 hours of a new channel. Therefore, I streamed a little bit on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/read365org). But to be honest I was not okay with fact that there were no sessions on YouTube for the first day of Read365. I simply had to record another session, or this was going to keep me awake all night. And it would have sabotaged my second day, setting off a chain reaction and the entire year would have been ruined like falling dominoes. Exaggeration strengthens the point. That is what I did here.
	2. It took an hour to upload a 1-hour file on YouTube. You must consider such hidden time leaks if you're planning to upload frequently.
2. I love taking notes while I read, and besides post-it notes, I have certain symbols and marks I leave on the pages of the books I read. But because I've decided to give away all the books I read this year, I just want to keep them clean. And this leads to an excessive use of post-its, as you might also see from the videos. I'll think about another solution, because it slows me down.
