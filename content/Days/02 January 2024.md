## Why did I start the marathon with the book Atomic Habits?

Even though I've read many articles by [[James Clear]] and read most of his book some years ago, I've not actually find the chance to finish it. I notice this pattern of myself not only in book reading, but in consuming any type of content that would take relatively long time to finish. I don't know the end of many popular tv series. I've left many good fiction series unfinished. I didn't even watch the last couple seasons of my favourite series of all time, [[Seinfeld]].

But the reason of choosing the book is different. I already know that, to be able to finish 365 books in a year while working full-time on your own business demands a completely new set of behaviors, that are aligned with a future self-image you intend to become. Which means, I must master how to regulate my own behaviors, habits and routines as soon as possible.

PS: Reading a book alone definitely will have almost no impact on your own life, unless you put the work to experiment with it in your own life. Remember, your life's a laboratory. Allow yourself to break things for the sake of finding the truth.

## The Plan

- YouTube will probably not allow me to stream until 10pm GMT+3, so I will probably stream on IG once again, starting at around 6.30pm. Then we could move on to YouTube at night.
