- I am thinking of doing 2 read sessions per day, one for the people in the US, and one for the people in EU. In any case I am going to be reading an awful lot of pages this year, so why not more streams?
- Song of the day is [Overnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTdBc2Ba8ts), by Parcels. (I don't promise to do this everyday.)

## Why Building a StoryBrand?

Because believe it or not, anything has a brand. Not just businesses, but individuals. And even materials. Gold as a material has a brand. A pretty strong one. And it is the brand that determines the persistence of that particular thing. What that means is, you better start on consciously shape your own brand to persist in other people's minds.

Building a StoryBrand is a book that I read long time ago, that explains the fundamentals of establishing a brand identity adhering to the storytelling basics. It is a good starter that is somewhere between [[Branding]], [[Marketing]] and [[Storytelling]] domains.
