I remember reading the wise words from a successful entrepreneur some years ago. It was on his particular approach to reading books, and it was something like this:

> I never start reading a book with the goal to finish the book. I pick a book that I find interesting, and as I am reading it, I put the effort to spot anything that I can immediately apply in my own life. I take notes from it whenever I find such points relevant to my life. As soon as I get three of them, I just put the book back on the shelf, and go apply my own notes.

As I finish more and more books, I come to realize how valuable his advice for any reader, and especially for those who invests heavily in books when it comes to their personal growth.

Reading alone is yet another leisure activity if you have no intent to somehow practice what you read in your own life. It is almost no different than taking the dog for a walk.

You have to imbue your life with what you read by experimenting with it. By practicing it. *By walking the book, and not walking the dog.*
