Hey there. A late entry.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1h67S02nmM) is the pace and the mood I have right now at 12th day of this self-experimentation.

I feel like I am falling behind the time itself. I feel like I need to speed up and start moving a little bit faster than the days coming up every day. I need to get ahead of the days.

Time is the bitter ally. Not an enemy, but a bitter ally that teaches you how to play by constantly beating you, over and over again.

I will go on with the book [[Storyworthy]]. I highly recommend the book for anyone that wants to become socially more penetrative. I'll also be synthesizing the parts that I'll be experimenting with. Let's meet at the [reading harbor](https://www.youtube.com/@read365org) at 10pm GMT+3.

Peace.
