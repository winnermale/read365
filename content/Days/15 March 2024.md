Ã‡amur, my old friend that I had been living together for 15 years, has passed away on Monday. It is one of those moments, when you wish you had strong writing skills, to be able to articulate and convey the gravity of the loss, and then you realize that the quality of such a transmission is a function also of the receiving end's capacity to comprehend it. If someone has never experienced similar loss, they'll just have no bandwidth to get what you have to say.

But I still will write of course, just to express myself. For now, let's leave something that have the ability to convey emotions much more [directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSiOjLT7M9w).

Rest in peace, my old friend.
