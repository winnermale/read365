Whenever I intend to integrate a new behavior to my life, virtually anything that I expect to do repetitively, I always consider its auxiliaries, for the behavior to become both efficient and effective. 

I am a cross-functional aggregate of several minor systems, working in harmony. And I, as the aggregate, involve in any activity for a particular outcome. We are strictly goal-driven animals, i.e. there is not even a single moment where I function without any particular goal, even though we constantly transition between a variety of goals.
