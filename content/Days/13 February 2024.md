After a huge break. I'm back.

Just came here to say a few things that I noticed. 

Read365 desperately needs a fixed hour, even though it is not easy for me to do it. It has already become comfortable for me streaming on a daily basis, yet doing it at the same hour every day takes the discipline it demands to whole another level. 

But I realize that it is required for the project to be continuous not only for me, but for the people who'll be joining the reading together sessions. 

If you make it a big deal, it'll become a big deal.

From now on, the official hour of the reading together sessions at our [YouTube harbor](https://www.youtube.com/@read365org/streams) is *21:00 GMT+3.* See you there.
